# MEMORY USER EDITS - SHORT PROMPTS FOR MEMORY GENERATION

Each line below is a separate memory edit prompt (under 200 characters).
Add these one by one using the memory_user_edits tool or interface.

User's name is Christopher.

Christopher prefers short, direct responses without unnecessary explanation.

Christopher prefers complete, ready-to-use files over code snippets.

Christopher is "not a coder" and needs exact commands with clear expectations.

Christopher prefers individual files over ZIP archives.

Christopher wants explicit notification when switching between software tools.

Project is called "Ads Control Tower" (A.C.T).

A.C.T is automated Google Ads optimization platform with safety guardrails.

Project location: C:\Users\User\Desktop\gads-data-layer

Development uses Master Chat (coordinate) + Worker Chats (execute) pattern.

Real customer ID: 7372844356. Test customer ID: 9999999999.

Rule 1: Worker chats start with 3 uploads: codebase ZIP, PROJECT_ROADMAP.md, CHAT_WORKING_RULES.md.

Rule 2: Request current file version before editing (never use cached).

Rule 3: Always use full Windows paths (C:\Users\...), never partial paths.

Christopher refuses to proceed if Rule 1 violated (no uploads).

Backend: Python 3.11, Flask, DuckDB. Frontend: Bootstrap 5, Chart.js, Vanilla JS.

Templates must extend base_bootstrap.html (not base.html).

Database queries use ro.analytics.* prefix.

All changes must pass Constitution framework guardrails.

Constitution enforces 7-day cooldowns, magnitude limits, data sufficiency.

All work must be tested before reporting complete (no exceptions).

Primary browser: Opera. Test in Chrome if issues.

Dashboard UI prioritized over reports/alerts.

System designed for multi-client agency use.

Christopher emphasizes thorough documentation and comprehensive testing.

Provide exact error outputs and terminal logs for debugging.

Escalate issues rather than continue circular debugging.

Flask application cache preferred over session storage (cookie limits).

Explicit dictionary mapping more reliable than asdict() for serialization.
